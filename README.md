Hi, I'm Pedro , i am studying sports science at Unicamp on brazil 
Me and my friends are developing a system to a group named AAASE on the university 
this group is more like a studying body that promoves sports events and championships ,you know, stuff like that
I've never used github befofe and i want to learn it because one of my partners at the group told me
github can really help us to acomplish our goal , and we are very excited about it
I dont know why exactly i wrote all those things about me lmao, but if you wanna join us and help anyway you can, we'll be very thankful
